Japan is in the unenviable position of being one of the few nations in
recent history to have seen a striking reversal of economic
fortune. The original Asian success story, Japan rode one of the great
speculative stock and property bubbles of all time in the 1980s to
become the first Asian country to challenge the long dominance of the
West.

Japan has had the world’s second-largest economy for much of the last
four decades, according to the World Bank. And during the 1980s, there
was even talk about Japan’s economy some day overtaking that of the
United States.

But the bubbles popped in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and Japan
fell into a slow but relentless decline that neither enormous budget
deficits nor a flood of easy money has reversed. For nearly a
generation now, the nation has been trapped in low growth and a
corrosive downward spiral of prices, known as deflation, in the
process shriveling from an economic Godzilla to little more than an
afterthought in the global economy.

In the second quarter of 2010, China passed Japan to become the
world’s second-largest economy behind the United States. For Japan,
the statistic reflected a decline in economic and political power.
